**The Build-Measure-Learn Cycle:**

*Build Phase:*
- Create minimum viable tests for your hypotheses
- Focus on learning, not perfection
- Set clear success criteria before building

*Measure Phase:*
- Collect quantitative and qualitative data
- Track leading and lagging indicators
- Be honest about what the data shows

*Learn Phase:*
- Analyze results against hypotheses
- Identify what worked and what didn't
- Decide whether to persevere, iterate, or pivot

**Types of Pivots:**

*Customer Segment Pivot:*
- Keep the solution, change the target customer
- Example: B2B tool becomes B2C application

*Problem Pivot:*
- Keep the customer, solve a different problem
- Example: Productivity tool becomes collaboration platform

*Solution Pivot:*
- Keep the problem, change the approach
- Example: Custom AI becomes no-code platform

*Business Model Pivot:*
- Keep everything, change how you make money
- Example: Subscription becomes usage-based pricing

**Pivot Decision Framework:**
- **Persevere if:** Making steady progress toward product-market fit
- **Iterate if:** Close to product-market fit but need refinements
- **Pivot if:** Fundamental assumptions are proven wrong

**Common Pivot Triggers:**
- Customer acquisition is too expensive
- Customers don't use the product regularly
- Market is smaller than expected
- Technical approach isn't working
- Competitive landscape changes dramatically"
